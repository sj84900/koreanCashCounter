The dataset includes 13548 images.
10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50000 are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
